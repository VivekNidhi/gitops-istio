### **Controlling Configuration Scope**

By default Istio networking resources and services are visible to all services running in all namespaces that are part of the Istio service mesh. As you add more services to the mesh, the amount of sidecar proxy's configuration increases dramatically which will grow your sidecar proxy's memory accordingly. Thus this default behavior is not desired when you have more than a few services and not all of your services communicate to all other services.

The Sidecar resource is designed to solve this problem from the service consumer's perspective. This configuration allows you to configure the sidecar proxy that mediates inbound and outbound communication to the workload instance it is applicable to. The Export-To configuration allows service producers to declare the scope of the services to be exported. With both of these configurations, service owners can effectively control the scope of the sidecar configuration.

## Sidecar resource for service consumers

Let's declare services in the istioinaction namespace, those services are allowed to reach out to the web-api service in the istioinaction namespace via the default sidecar resource below:

`apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: Sidecar
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: istioinaction
spec:
  egress:
  - hosts:
    - "./web-api.istioinaction.svc.cluster.local"
    - "istio-system/*"
    - "istio-ingress/*"`
